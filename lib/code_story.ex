defmodule CodeStory do
  @moduledoc """
  A code comprehension tool for surveying unfamiliar Elixir code.

  Drop `CodeStory.tell()` into a function to see a nested call tree of
  user-defined function calls with named arguments, values, and return values.

  ## Usage

  Wrap the call you're curious about — the trace prints and your result flows
  through, no `stop/0` needed:

      invoice = CodeStory.tell(fn -> process_order(params) end)

  Or bracket a region by hand when a single entry call won't express it:

      CodeStory.tell()
      # ... your code ...
      CodeStory.stop()

  For the tree as data instead of a printed trace, see `narrate/2`.

  ## Options

    * `:show_args` - when `true` (default), shows argument names and values;
      when `false`, shows values only
    * `:output` - `:terminal` (default), `:file`, or `:both`. `:file` and
      `:both` write to `code_story_trace.log` in the project root. Because a
      trace records real argument and return values, that file can capture
      secrets (passwords, API keys, tokens) or personal data in plaintext —
      add it to your `.gitignore` and delete it when you are done with it.
    * `:detail` - `:outline` shows only function names and arg names (no values
      or returns) for inspecting call flow and boundaries;
      `:short_story` (default) shows names, truncated values, and returns;
      `:novel` shows names with complete untruncated values and returns
    * `:auto_boundary` - when `true` (default), Ecto repos are treated as
      *boundary modules*: a repo call (e.g. `Repo.get!`) is shown as a single
      node with its args and return, but the repo's own internal calls (Ecto
      plumbing, arity-delegation chains) are hidden. Set to `false` to trace
      repo internals.
    * `:fold_repeats` - when `true` (default), consecutive sibling calls to the
      same function collapse into one node marked `×N` (or `×N (varies)` when the
      calls share a function but differ). Set to `false` to show every call.
    * `:depth` - caps how many levels the rendered trace nests. A positive
      integer (`depth: 1` shows the entry call only; `depth: 2` adds its direct
      children; etc.); below the cap a node's interior is replaced by a
      `… (N more levels)` marker. Defaults to `:infinity` (no limit).
    * `:width` - the line-width budget (default `100`) for the compact inline
      call signature `Mod.fun(name: value, …) => return`. A call whose assembled
      line fits within `:width` renders inline; a longer one falls back to the
      stacked layout (name / one arg per line / return). Raise it for a wide
      terminal, lower it for a strict slide.

  @collector_key :code_story_collector

  @doc """
  Traces user-defined function calls and prints the call tree. Two forms.

  ## Block form — `tell(fun)` / `tell(fun, opts)`

  Wrap the entry call you want to understand. The trace prints, tracing is cleaned
  up automatically (no `stop/0`), and `fun`'s own result is returned — so it's a
  transparent wrapper you can drop around any expression:

      invoice = CodeStory.tell(fn -> process_order(params) end)

  This is the recommended form when surveying unfamiliar code: you know the *entry*
  even when you don't know where the flow *ends*. A single entry call is still the
  clearest thing to wrap, but `fun` may hold several: every top-level call becomes
  a root of the trace, in call order. That matters when the entry point is
  framework code the tracer does not follow -- your own functions are then reached
  as a sequence, not as one call. It **never breaks the wrapped
  code** — if a trace is already active, tracing fails to start, or the trace can't
  be displayed, `fun` still runs and its result is still returned (with a warning).
  Unlike `narrate/2` (which raises on an active trace), the block form warns and
  continues.

  ## Manual form — `tell()` / `tell(opts)` + `stop/0`

  Bracket a region by hand (e.g. a LiveView handler, or a span across several
  statements) when a single entry call won't express it:

      CodeStory.tell()
      result = process_order(params)
      CodeStory.stop()

  The manual form returns `:ok`, or `{:error, :already_tracing}` (with a warning)
  if a trace is already active.

  Both forms accept the options in the [module docs](`CodeStory`) — `:show_args`,
  `:output`, `:detail`, `:auto_boundary`, `:fold_repeats`, `:depth`, `:width`:

      CodeStory.tell(fn -> entry() end, detail: :outline)
      CodeStory.tell(detail: :novel, output: :file)

  For the tree as data instead of a printed trace, see `narrate/2`.

  Stops tracing and outputs the call tree collected since `tell/1`.

  The entire trace is written as one buffered block, using the `:output` and
  `:detail` options given to `tell/1` — so the tree never interleaves with other
  IO from your code.

  Always returns `:ok`. Warns and returns `:ok` if no trace is active on this
  process, so a stray `stop/0` is harmless.

  @doc """
  Runs `fun` while tracing, returning `{result, tree}` without printing.

  `result` is whatever `fun` returned; `tree` is the raw call tree as data — a
  list of `%{module, function, args, return, children}` node maps. This is the
  programmatic counterpart to `tell/0` + `stop/0`: nothing is written to the
  terminal or a file, and no display transforms (folding, depth) are applied — the
  tree is the honest, full structure. Pair it with `to_encodable/2` to get
  JSON-ready data.

      {invoice, tree} = CodeStory.narrate(fn -> process_order(params) end)

  Notes:

    * Traces the calling process. Every top-level call inside `fun` becomes a root
      of the returned tree, in call order, so `fun` may bracket a region rather
      than wrap a single entry call. A `fun` with no traced calls returns
      `{result, []}`. ⚠ Calls made by processes that `fun` spawns are not traced.
    * `opts` are trace-time only — currently `:auto_boundary` (default `true`, as in
      `tell/1`). Pass `auto_boundary: false` to include an Ecto repo's internals in
      the raw tree.
    * **Raises** `ArgumentError` if a trace is already active on this process
      (unlike `tell/1`, which returns `{:error, :already_tracing}` — a tagged tuple
      would be ambiguous with a legitimate `{:error, tree}` result).

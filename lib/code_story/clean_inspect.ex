defmodule CodeStory.CleanInspect do
  @moduledoc """
  Inspects a value, then strips Ecto bookkeeping noise from the resulting string —
  `__meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<…>` and `#Ecto.Association.NotLoaded<…>` — so a
  trace shows `%Order{id: 12, status: "paid", …}` instead of the full Ecto internals.

  One value-shaped exception precedes the string cleaning: `inspect/2` first
  delegates a top-level `Ecto.Query` value to `CodeStory.QueryLabel`, which renders
  it as a compact `#Ecto.Query<Schema>` label (at the summary detail levels only).
  Everything else follows the string-cleaning path below.

  We clean the **inspected string**, not the value: removing `__meta__` from the
  value pre-inspect turns the struct into a plain map (`%{…, __struct__: Mod}`),
  losing the `%Mod{…}` name. CodeStory has no Ecto dependency — detection is purely
  string-shaped.

  ## Known limitations

  Because this is string-cleaning, not value-cleaning:

    * a struct with `__meta__` as its *only* field isn't stripped (no adjacent `, `) —
      real schemas always have an `id`/fields, so this never happens in practice;
    * a `NotLoaded` association whose name isn't a bare identifier (`\\w+`) isn't
      dropped — rare;
    * a genuine string value that literally contains the full
      `__meta__: #Ecto.Schema.Metadata<…>` field shape would be edited — the
      unavoidable cost of the chosen approach; low likelihood (a bare
      `#Ecto.Schema.Metadata<…>` substring, with no `__meta__:` prefix, is untouched);
    * under a compact `:limit`, stripping a `NotLoaded`/nested-struct field can show
      one fewer real field at that level (only the top-level `__meta__` slot is
      compensated by the limit bump below).

  # Compact vs. full inspect options, keyed to the `:detail` level. Both callers —
  # `CodeStory.Formatter` and `CodeStory.Encoder` — route through `opts_for/1`, so this
  # mapping has a single home rather than a copy in each module kept in sync by comment.
  #
  # INVARIANT: these opts must keep inspect output single-line — the strip regexes below
  # key on a literal `, ` field separator. Do NOT add `pretty: true`: it would wrap wide
  # values onto `,\n` lines and make every strip below silently no-op. (`width` is inert
  # without `pretty`, so it is deliberately omitted here.)
